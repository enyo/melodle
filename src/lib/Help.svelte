<p>Guess the melody in 6 tries.</p>

<p>
  Before each guess, you can play the melody <strong>once</strong>. Listen to
  the reference C' tone first to make sure your audio is working.
</p>

<p>
  After a guess, it is revealed which notes are correct. When the game is over,
  you'll also see which notes you missed by just one key.
</p>

<h2>Mobile users</h2>

<p>
  Make sure your phone is not on silent mode, otherwise you won't be able to
  hear anything.
</p>

<h2>Desktop users</h2>
<p>
  You can use the keyboard with the corresponding keys. To get a sharp note, you
  can use the up / down arrow keys.
</p>

<h2>Notation</h2>

I try to detect the notation style based on your language preferences. You can
change it anytime in the settings. There's also a solf√®ge syllables notation.
